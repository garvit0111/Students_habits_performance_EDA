# 🧠 Student Habits & Performance – EDA Project

This project explores how various student habits such as study hours, sleep patterns, diet, and extracurricular activities affect academic performance and mental health.

## 📌 Overview

- 🎯 Objective: To understand the relationship between student lifestyle habits and their performance using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- 📊 Dataset Source: Kaggle ([Student Habits & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/))
- 🔍 Analysis Type: Both guided and unguided — used GPT-4 for explanations and studied independently to deepen understanding.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Excel (initial data cleaning)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧼 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Downloaded from Kaggle.
2. **Cleaning**: Removed missing values, standardized column names, handled duplicates using Excel and Pandas.
3. **EDA**:
   - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
   - Distribution plots, count plots, and pairwise visualizations
   - Correlation heatmap to explore relationships between numeric features
4. **Insights**:
   - Sleep duration has a strong positive correlation with mental health.
   - Study hours influence exam performance.
   - Internet quality, diet, and exercise patterns vary across student groups.
   - Part-time job and extracurricular activities show interesting associations with gender and lifestyle factors.

## 📈 Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with real-world data cleaning.
- Improved understanding of visualization techniques.
- Practiced drawing actionable insights from data patterns.
- Balanced guided help (via GPT) with self-learning through experimentation.

## 📊 Coming Soon

🚧 I’m currently working on building an **interactive dashboard** (using Streamlit/Power BI) for this project to make insights more accessible and dynamic.
